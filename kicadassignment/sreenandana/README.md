## Decade Counter with CD4017 and Push Button

Use the CD4017 IC with a push button to manually increment the count.
Connect an LED(Via a resistor) to each output pin of the decade counter) . Each time the switch is pushed, the next LED should glow.

Components:

+ CD4017 Decade Counter IC
+ Push Button (to manually trigger clock pulses)
+ Debouncing Circuit (for stable input, optional but recommended)
   +   1kΩ resistor
   + 100nF capacitor
+ Resistors: (e.g., 220Ω for LEDs)
+ LEDs (to visualize the output states)
+ Power Supply: 2 pin input socket
