Voltage Follower (Buffer):

+ Components: Op-amp.
+ Objective: Build a voltage follower to act as a buffer between two stages of a circuit. This will help you understand the op-amp's high input impedance and low output impedance characteristics, essential for signal isolation.

This is basically a non-inverting amplifier with Rf=0 (shorted) , and Ri=infinity(not connected). The gain is therefor = 1.
